1. Apply a simple Breadth First Search over the string and an element of the queue used for BFS will contain the pair str, 
pos where pos is the position of _ in the string str.
2. Also maintain a map namely ‘vis’ which will store the string as key and the minimum moves to get to the string as value.
3. For every string str from the queue, generate a new string tmp based on the four conditions given and update the vis map as vis[tmp] = vis[str] + 1.
4. Repeat the above steps until the queue is empty or the required string is generated i.e. tmp == B
5. If the required string is generated, then return vis[str] + 1 which is the minimum number of operations required to change A to B.
